## ‚úçÔ∏è Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from students, alumni, and collaborators. To keep the repository clean and organized:

- **Please do not edit this top-level `README.md`.**
- All contributions should be made **within the appropriate subdirectories**.
- If you're adding a new file:
  - Use descriptive names (e.g., `example_project.md`, `demo_diagram.png`).
  - Optionally include a short `README.md` inside the folder to explain contents.
- Direct commits or pull requests are both welcome, depending on your workflow.

If you're unsure where something belongs, consider creating a thread or asking in the connected community (e.g., Discord, group chat, etc.).
