# OPC UA Overview

## What is OPC UA?

**OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture)** is a platform-independent, service-oriented communication protocol used in industrial automation and IoT. It enables secure, reliable, and structured data exchange between devices, systems, and applications.

Developed by the OPC Foundation, OPC UA supports:
- Object-oriented modeling of devices and processes
- Secure and encrypted data communication
- Interoperability across vendors and platforms

OPC UA is widely adopted in Industry 4.0, SCADA, MES, and IIoT systems.

## OPC UA in the OSI Model

OPC UA spans multiple layers of the OSI model, offering both transport and application-level functionality:

| OSI Layer        | OPC UA Role                                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 7 – Application  | OPC UA client-server interface, data modeling, services |
| 6 – Presentation | Encoding formats (e.g., XML, JSON, binary)              |
| 5 – Session      | Session and secure channel management                   |
| 4 – Transport    | TCP, HTTPS, WebSockets                                  |
| 3 – Network      | IP addressing                                           |
| 2 – Data Link    | Ethernet or Wi-Fi                                       |
| 1 – Physical     | Physical Ethernet or wireless hardware                  |

OPC UA uses **TCP** for binary communication, **HTTPS** for web-based access, and optionally **MQTT** or **WebSockets** for cloud integration.

## When to Use OPC UA

Use OPC UA when:

- You need **structured, secure, and vendor-neutral data exchange**
- You're building **SCADA, MES, or edge-to-cloud** solutions
- Devices must **share semantically rich data models**, not just raw values
- You want **built-in authentication, encryption, and user access control**
- Integration spans **diverse platforms** (Linux, Windows, embedded, cloud)

## OPC UA vs MQTT vs Socket Communication

| Feature                    | OPC UA                              | MQTT                          | Raw Sockets                   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Use Case**              | Structured, secure IIoT/SCADA data   | Lightweight telemetry, IoT     | Custom, low-level comms       |
| **Architecture**          | Client/Server & Pub/Sub              | Broker-based Pub/Sub          | Client/Server                 |
| **Security**              | Built-in (TLS, certs, auth)          | Optional (depends on broker)  | Custom (not standardized)     |
| **Data Modeling**         | Rich object models, metadata         | Flat topic/value pairs        | Raw binary or string data     |
| **Efficiency**            | Moderate                             | Very high                     | Very high                     |
| **Interoperability**      | High (vendor neutral)                | Medium                        | Low                           |
| **Best for**              | Factory data, OT/IT integration      | IoT telemetry, edge devices   | Real-time or legacy systems   |

## Summary

Choose **OPC UA** when:
- You need **context-rich, secure communication** between diverse systems
- You're working with **enterprise or industrial software** like SCADA, MES, or ERP

Choose **MQTT** when:
- You want **fast, low-bandwidth communication** from constrained or mobile devices
- You’re pushing data from edge devices to a **cloud broker**

Choose **Sockets** when:
- You need **custom real-time communication** with minimal overhead
- Devices don’t support higher-level protocols and you control both ends
