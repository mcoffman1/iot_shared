## Part 2: Download the communication library

1. Visit the official Siemens support page for the communication libraries:
    
    https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109780503
    
2. Scroll down to the **“Download”** section.
3. Select the appropriate version for your installed TIA Portal
4. Click the **download icon**.
5. Accept the license terms if prompted.
6. Download and unzip the archive on your computer.

## Part 3: Import the library into TIA Portal

1. Open your project in **TIA Portal**.
2. Go to the **“Project Library”** panel.
3. Right-click and select: **Manage libraries** → **Open library**.
4. Browse for the `.al#` file you downloaded. (# represents the version of Tia in use) 
5. The library will open as a **Global Library**.
6. From there, you can drag and drop function blocks, data types, and other components into your project.

## Part 4: Set-Up **LMQTT_Client FB**

### a) Add the LMQTT_Client FB to a Network**

1. Open **TIA Portal** and navigate to the program block where you want to implement MQTT communication.
2. In an empty network, insert a new **Function Block (FB)**.
3. Search for and select: `LMQTT_Client`.
4. When prompted, create an associated Data Block for the FB.
5. Accept the default name: `LMQTT_Client_DB`.

### b) Create a New Data Block for Parameters

1. Go to **Program blocks** → right-click → **Add new block**.
2. Choose **Data Block**.
3. Name it as desired (e.g., Data_block_MQTT).

### c) Open the Data Block and add the following variables:

### d) Set up the variables values as:

QoS = 1 (publishing accepts 2 but subscribing only 1)

Retain = 1

willMsgLen=100

mqttTopic=test ( feel free to use other topic)

### e) Now, on connParam, set up the ip and the port of our broker

## Part 5: Link the Variables to the FB
1. Return to the network where the `LMQTT_Client` FB is located.
2. Connect each FB parameter to the corresponding variable in the `Block_IoT_MQTT`.
3. Ensure proper assignment:

#### **Recommendation**

For detailed information about each parameter's behavior, refer to the official documentation provided by Siemens on the download page for the **LMQTT_Client** library.

## Part 6: Create a Watch and Force tables

![Siemens MQTT Image 0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcoffman1/iot_shared/main/MQTT/SIEMENS/IMAGES/14.png)

Add the following variables into the Watch table

![Siemens MQTT Image 0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcoffman1/iot_shared/main/MQTT/SIEMENS/IMAGES/15.png)

Download and lets test, and monitor all in the watch table

![Siemens MQTT Image 0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcoffman1/iot_shared/main/MQTT/SIEMENS/IMAGES/16.png)

In “publishMsgPayload”, you can choose the type of variable you want to send. For this example, leave it set to HEX. We’ll publish the character “A”, which corresponds to 16#41, so replace 16#00 with 16#41.
Make sure the mqttTopic is set to 'test'. Then, click Modify, and set the values to 1 or True for “enable: and “publish”.

Now check the subscriber to see if it received the message.

To receive data, just publish the desired information externally, like this:

![Siemens MQTT Image 0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcoffman1/iot_shared/main/MQTT/SIEMENS/IMAGES/18.png)

Check the receivedMsgPayload in the Watch table. The value should change from 16#00 to 16#42, which corresponds to the character B.
