# Rockwell EtherNet/IP to FANUC Communication

This folder will contain setup guides for direct communication between **Rockwell PLCs** and **FANUC robots** using the **EtherNet/IP protocol**.

## Status

Documentation is currently in progress.

## In the Meantime

While the full step-by-step guides are being developed, you can get started by reviewing these example videos.  One shows setup with generic modules, and the other can be use with EDS and Fanuc specific modules.

- [Generic Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKRgSFWrCUU&t=289s)
- [Fanuc Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFzRGiBJBrg)

These videos cover the basic process of setting up FANUC as an EtherNet/IP Adapter and linking it to a Rockwell PLC using Studio 5000.

More detailed guides and example files will be added here soon.
