# Direct Communication Setup Guides

This folder contains setup guides and configuration examples for **one-to-one communication** between industrial devices and robots using common industrial protocols.

## What You'll Find Here

- Step-by-step instructions for establishing direct communication links.
- Code samples, configuration tips, and troubleshooting notes.
- links to setup videos

## Covered Protocols

- **Socket Communication** – Raw TCP/UDP message exchange between devices.
- **EtherNet/IP** – Industrial protocol widely used with Rockwell PLCs and compatible robots.
- **PROFINET** – Real-time Ethernet-based communication used with Siemens PLCs and compatible controllers.

## Use Case

These resources are useful when:
- Two devices need to talk directly without a broker or server.
- Low-latency, deterministic communication is required.
- You're integrating robots, PLCs, or edge devices in a lab or industrial setting.

For centralized or broker-based communication (like MQTT or OPC UA), see the relevant folders in this repository.
