# üåê PROFINET Overview

## What is PROFINET?

**PROFINET** (Process Field Net) is an **industrial Ethernet protocol** developed by **Siemens** and maintained by **PI (PROFIBUS & PROFINET International)**. It enables real-time communication between controllers (like PLCs) and field devices (like robots, drives, and sensors) across standard Ethernet networks.

PROFINET is based on standard Ethernet and offers:
- Real-time deterministic I/O communication
- Scalable performance (RT and IRT modes)
- Seamless integration with Siemens engineering tools (e.g., TIA Portal)

## PROFINET in the OSI Model

PROFINET maps to the OSI model as follows:

| OSI Layer        | PROFINET Role                                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 7 ‚Äì Application  | PROFINET IO protocol ‚Äì device data exchange              |
| 6 ‚Äì Presentation | Data encoding, GSDML device profiles                     |
| 5 ‚Äì Session      | Session setup (implicit in real-time exchange)           |
| 4 ‚Äì Transport    | Uses UDP/TCP or specialized transport for IRT            |
| 3 ‚Äì Network      | IP ‚Äì device addressing                                   |
| 2 ‚Äì Data Link    | Ethernet (with prioritized frames for IRT)               |
| 1 ‚Äì Physical     | Ethernet (cables, switches, connectors)                  |

**Key Types of Communication:**
- **PROFINET RT** ‚Äì Real-time communication for most automation tasks
- **PROFINET IRT** ‚Äì Isochronous Real-Time for motion control and sub-millisecond precision

## When to Use PROFINET

Use PROFINET when:

- You're working with **Siemens PLCs** (e.g., S7-1200, S7-1500)
- You need **deterministic, low-latency** communication between devices
- You're integrating **robots**, **I/O modules**, or **drives** into a Siemens-based automation system
- You require **IRT-level timing** for motion control or coordinated systems

---

## Use Cases

- Connecting a **Siemens PLC** to:
  - A **UR robot** or other PROFINET-compatible robotic controller
  - Distributed I/O modules (e.g., ET200)
  - Servo drives, HMIs, safety systems

- High-performance machine automation with tight timing requirements
